 I donated a few weeks ago at my 23 week mark (my friend Chelsie and her baby Henry were on my mind) and will donate again in the future when I have the funds available. I never expected to actually need to send a request on behalf of a friend (especially one due after me in mid july). Thanks for all that you do.
